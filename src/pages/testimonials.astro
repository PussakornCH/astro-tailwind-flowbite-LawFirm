    text: "✦ We had the best experience with Atty. Remo during our immigration/visa processing. He was very knowledgeable on the process and what needs to be done. He explained every step, answered all questions, and was very honest about the possible timeline and even expectations. He also made sure every document was submitted correctly and promptly. What could have been an overwhelming process turned into a smooth journey, all because we had the right person with us. Atty. Remo and his team truly care about the welfare of their clients, and go above and beyond to help navigate through the whole process.",

    topic: "Clear Communication & Fast Results",
    text: "✦ I met Atty. William Remo because someone posted on social media that he was a good lawyer and could take care of his clients because USCIS had issued him a Green Card in just 3 months. So I sent a message to the person who posted and asked if I could get the atty's contact number. He gave it to me. After I got the contact number, I called atty. He asked what I needed, I said that I would ask for help in the process to get a Green card. So he told me to prepare all the necessary things. But from time to time he would email me, or call and text me. When atty submitted my documents, we immediately received a PD (Priority Date) then a Biometric schedule, after Biometric about 3 weeks I received my SSN, Then EAD and then Travel Documents, my Green Card was approved in just 4 months. So all I can say is Thank you very much, Atty. and your staff! I hope you can help others more.",

    topic: "Avoid Costly Mistakes with Professional Help",
    text: "✦ I helped my brother filed for a family-sponsored green card almost 3 years ago, believing it would be simple, and we would just learn on the fly. Oh boy! How wrong I was. After 3 years, thousands of dollars worth of mistakes, and last but not least the time’s spent panicking over mistakes and shifting laws and worrying about what would go wrong next. If I can do it all over again, I would have asked an immigration lawyer for help! ✦ Everyone's situation is different. Your case might be easier than ours. However, having an expert like William guiding you through will help you keep your peace of mind and avoid unnecessary mistakes, saving money and, most importantly in this political climate, time. ✦ I met William around a year ago. He is a great mini golf player and even better friend. When he learned that my brother was going through the green card process and having a lot of problems, he didn’t hesitate to offer help and advice. William reassured us by telling us what to look out for and what to do next. He would be there for us if something went wrong again. He kept checking in on our progress. His presence gave us the peace of mind we lost. And in my opinion that is worth more than anything you can own.",
